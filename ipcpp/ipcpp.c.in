@section libcard_game How Libcard_game works

This library was created to makes easy creation of an Card Game.

Libcard_game reads a xml file containing the rules to be used in the game.
This rules are associated with a function, that implements how the rule works.

@section deps Depends

XML_Parser - A little wrapper of libxml2 made by me.

eina - Libcard_game uses only the Eina_Module part of the eina.
Libcard_game uses eina_module to load libraries in runtime, to map the rules with your functions.
