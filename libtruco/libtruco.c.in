@section libtruco How Libtruco works

This library was created to makes easy creation of an Truco game.

Libtruco reads a xml file containing the rules to be used in the game.
This rules are associated with a function, that implements how the rule works.

@section deps Depends

libxml2 - For reads the xml file with the rules.

eina - Libtruco uses only the Eina_Module part of the eina.
Libtruco uses eina_module to load libraries in runtime, to map the rules with your functions.
