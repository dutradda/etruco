@section Discarga How Discarga works

This library was created to makes easy creation of an Distributed Card Game.

Discarga reads a xml file containing the rules to be used in the game.
This rules are associated with a function, that implements how the rule works.

@section deps Depends

XML_Parser - A little wrapper of libxml2 made by me =).
IPCPP - A little wrapper of ecore-ipc made by me =).

eina - Discarga uses only the Eina_Module part of the eina.
Discarga uses eina_module to load libraries in runtime, to map the rules with your functions.
